      <h2>About CoBot</h2>

      <p>CoBot is a discovery tool for the regenerative economy. It searches a directory of thousands of organisations — cooperatives, community projects, Transition Towns, social enterprises and more — across hundreds of countries.</p>

      <p>What makes it different is where the data comes from.</p>

      <h3>Decentralised data, not a central database</h3>

      <p>CoBot draws on data profiles enabled by the <a href="https://murmurations.network" target="_blank">Murmurations protocol</a>. Murmurations is an open protocol that lets organisations publish structured data about themselves in a decentralised way — no central authority controls the data, no single organisation decides who gets listed, and no one can gatekeep access.</p>

      <p>Each organisation creates a small data profile (a JSON file) and hosts it wherever they choose — on their own website, on a shared server, or via the Murmurations tools. These profiles are then picked up by the Murmurations Index, which aggregates them without owning them.</p>

      <h3>Why this is better than any centralised directory</h3>

      <p>Centralised directories have a fundamental problem: someone has to maintain them. That means someone decides the categories, someone approves entries, someone keeps things up to date — and inevitably, things go stale, coverage is patchy, and the directory reflects the biases and capacity of whoever runs it.</p>

      <p>The Murmurations approach turns this on its head:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Organisations own their data.</strong> They create, update and control their own profiles. No one else can edit or remove them.</li>
        <li><strong>Anyone can build on it.</strong> Because the data is open and decentralised, anyone can build tools like CoBot on top of it — different views, different filters, different purposes, all from the same shared data layer.</li>
        <li><strong>It scales without gatekeepers.</strong> There is no approval process, no editorial bottleneck. If you publish a valid profile, you're in.</li>
        <li><strong>It stays fresh.</strong> Because organisations maintain their own profiles, the data is more likely to be current than a directory maintained by a third party.</li>
        <li><strong>It can't be captured.</strong> No single entity owns the network. The protocol is open, the data is distributed, and the index is a utility, not a product.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is how directories should work — built from the ground up by the people and organisations they represent, not imposed from the top down.</p>
